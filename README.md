Team name: Resto-To-Door

Team Members: Kaolin Stacey, Eris Degani

We will build a web application where registered admins to restaurant company owners can create and manage their online stores; where there clients can then place an order for delivery. Upon doing so, they order will be confirmed and the estimated delivery time will be given.

Our project will support the following:
-	 As a owner, I can quickly request to add, delete, or alter the list of available custom options for their store. (3)
-	 As a owner, I have the ability to see the most sold items along with the profits by category. (2)
-    As a owner, I can see all purchases made and set the status as not-started, in-progress or completed. (2)
-    As a owner, I can respond to specific requests with a comment stating whether it is possible or not. (1)

-    As a client, I can use an interactive UI to create my own custom order. (1)
-    As a client, I can see what my order will roughly look like based on the options I gave. (1)
-	 As a client, I can filter products and options/customisations by size, type, colours, flavours or more. (1)
-	 As a client, I have access to my shopping cart and can make adjustments to it. (2)
-	 As a client, I can see the estimate price when I am about to place the order.(1)
-	 As a client, I can pick a date and/or time for my order. (1)
-	 As a client, I will receive notifications in the form of emails or phone messages whenever the order is confirmed, on route for        delivery and delivered. (1)
-	 As a client, I can insert my credit card information to pay and then place my order. (1)
-	 As a client, I can review any past orders. (1)
-	 As a user, I can register myself as a client (0)


Our site will be modelled after a well-known online shops called [DoorDash](https://www.doordash.com/en-CA) & 
[UberEats](https://www.ubereats.com/ca). 

We estimate our project will take approximately 130 hours, 65 hours per team member. This comes to about 6 hours per week per team member for this project.
